🌍 AirSense – Real-Time Air Quality & Pollution Monitor

AirSense is a web-based smart pollution monitoring system that visualizes real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data across multiple monitoring stations in a city.
It helps people understand local pollution levels, get health alerts, and see how air quality changes throughout the day.

✨ Features

📍 Interactive Map – View AQI from multiple monitoring stations in a city.

🔥 Heatmap Overlay – Visualize pollution intensity zones across the city.

📊 Forecasting Chart – Simple 12-hour AQI forecast (traffic peaks, night dips).

🏥 Health Guidance – Personalized alerts (e.g., “Wear a mask”, “Safe to go outside”).

🏙 Multi-Station Support – Averages AQI from several stations for accuracy.

⚡ Lightweight UI – Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js & Chart.js.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Mapping: Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap)

Charts: Chart.js

Heatmap: Leaflet.heat

Data API: AQICN (Air Quality Open Data Platform)

🚀 How It Works

User selects a city.

AirSense fetches real-time AQI data from AQICN’s API (using your API token).

The system plots stations on the map, generates a heatmap, and updates the forecast chart.

Health tips and alerts are displayed based on AQI category.

📌 Use Cases

Students & citizens checking daily air quality before outdoor activities.

Environmental clubs or hackathons to demonstrate real-time pollution monitoring.

Awareness projects to promote health and sustainability.
